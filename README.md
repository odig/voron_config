# Voron config for Klipper
For now this is a technology study.
Use it at your own risk.

Clone the repo in your klipper_config as config_voron and run install.sh

    cd ~/klipper_config
    git clone https://github.com/odig/voron_config.git config_voron
    config_voron/scripts/install.sh

Copy the printer.cfg template as a sample config and adjust it to your needs.

The following command will override you existing printer.cfg!

    config_voron/scripts/install-voron-2-4-config.sh
